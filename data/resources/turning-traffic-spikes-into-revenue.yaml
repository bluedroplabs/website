          <p>POWDR operates 15+ high-traffic marketing websites for their outdoor recreation portfolio, serving millions of visitors annually with massive seasonal traffic spikes. Guests purchase lift tickets, book lodging, and buy season passes, making website performance directly tied to revenue.</p>
          <p>They were facing escalating hosting costs, and despite the "enterprise" price tag, they experienced frequent timeout issues during traffic spikes, slow support through bureaucratic ticket systems, and technical problems that directly impacted revenue. The platform was expensive, unreliable, and unable to handle their actual needs.</p>
          <p>Blue Drop Labs provided managed Drupal hosting with flat-rate pricing, unlimited bandwidth, and direct access to senior engineers for premium support. We became an extension of POWDR's team rather than just another vendor, resulting in lower costs and increased stability.</p>

          <h2>Revenue protection</h2>
          <p>When POWDR's sites experience timeouts or slow loading during peak booking periods, they lose sales. The new hosting infrastructure ensures that high-traffic moments translate to revenue rather than frustrated customers and abandoned carts. Annual Drupal version upgrades happen strategically during the summer months to reduce risk during the peak season.</p>

          <h2>Faster response to business needs</h2>
          <p>Development teams no longer dread deployments. With build times reduced from 5 minutes to 40 seconds and zero timeout failures, they can push updates, fixes, and new features confidently. This means faster response to business needs and reduced developer stress during critical launch windows.</p>
