    description: "Blue Drop's platform is a purpose-built infrastructure for Drupal sites of all sizes. Pantheon and Acquia have dominated the market, but they've become overpriced and bogged down with bureaucracy. Every Drupal website deserves a good home that doesn't break the budget. <br /><br />Our platform is built and maintained with the benefit of deep Drupal expertise. Every member of our team has 10+ years of Drupal experience. We know how it works, how it runs, and how to keep it optimized. "
